# Weather Forecast Application

Weather Application for current weather and 5-day forecast

The purpose of the application is to allow users to easily search and retrieve the weather forecast via the OpenWeatherMap API

## Description

    This is a simple weather forecast application to be used by any traveler to get the weather outlook for any city to plan for the weather accordingly.

    When a user opens the weather app, they are presented with a clean page that includes a search bar. When a user input the city name, they are presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history. The search history only allows to store up to 5 city searches in order to keep the page easy to use. If the user populates weather conditions for over 5 cities, the next time they reload the page, all the cities but 3 will be removed from the view.

    When a specific city is searched, the user sees:

    A Section for current weather conditions for that city and the following details:
    
    - the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index
    - The UV index populates a color that indicates if the UV conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe

    A section with further weather conditions for the next 5 days with the following details:
    
    - the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, and the humidity
    
    When the user clicks on a city in the search history
    - thery are presented with current and future conditions for that city
    - when the user opens the weather dashboard they are presented with the last searched city forecast
